# EEGtoEmotions
Made in colaboration with Tadej Vobner and an outside mentor from the Institute of Joseph Stephan dr. Bernard Å½enko. In our research, we wanted to find out how emotions are related to EEG signals and to predict emotions based on these EEG signals. The raw data is preprocessed with [differential entropy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/differential-entropy). The full article has been published on [zbirke.zotks](https://zbirke.zotks.si/2022/resources/SS_inter_1099.pdf).

## To note
1. The EEG data is not in the public domain
2. The first versions of the models were made in [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/docs/), to speed up the testing the different models
